In modern democratic societies, the political opinions of citizens are primarily expressed through public opinion polls and media. However, in recent times in Korea, the trust in these traditional indicators has sharply declined.

During President Yoon Suk-yeol’s impeachment crisis, the Myeongtaegyun Gate revealed that politically manipulated public opinion polls were being disseminated through the media. The fact that extreme and false information created on social media platforms—including YouTube—is influencing politics has greatly shocked Korean citizens.

Against this backdrop, citizens took to the streets to express their political views directly and physically. This project aims to analyze the protest data from these citizens and visualize it on urban spaces, thereby proposing a new map of democracy that can complement the existing distorted public opinion polls and media.
